 ## Key Activities: 
1.Data Collection-Collecting data from a sample dataset, CSV file, or API.

2.Data Preprocessing-Cleaning and organizing the data into a suitable format for analysis.

3.Data Analysis-Calculating summary statistics such as total, average, and other metrics.

4.Data Visualization-Creating charts and graphs to visually represent the data.

5.Automated Report Generation-Automatically generating a report (PDF/HTML) that includes analysis results and visualizations.

6.Output Storage-Saving the generated reports and images for future reference.

7.Version Control-Uploading the project files to GitHub for tracking and sharing.
